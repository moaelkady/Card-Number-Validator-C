# Card Number Validator
Card Number Validator is a simple program written in `C` that checks whether a given credit card number is valid or not. This program uses the Luhn algorithm to validate the credit card numbers.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Card Number Validator, download the source code and compile it using a `C` compiler. After compiling, run the program and enter a credit card number to check whether it is valid or not.

## How it Works
The program prompts the user to enter a credit card number. The entered number is then passed through the Luhn algorithm to determine if it is a valid card number. If the entered number is valid, the program prints "Valid Card Number", otherwise, it prints "Invalid Card Number".

## Limitations
Card Number Validator only checks the validity of the credit card number based on the Luhn algorithm. It does not check whether the card number is actually issued by a valid financial institution or whether the card has sufficient funds.
